# SocialDashboard
Social Media Dashboard using Python Django and SQLite
This is a Social Media Dashboard which works in accordance to the features as follows:
    Here, since I was really short on time, I have created the entire backend and couldn't make it visually appealing. So          sorry about that :(
    To run this dashboard, setup the environment (the regular way - ./env/venv) using the cmd prompt
    Activate the environment and the scripts
    Run the main file.
Now for the code part lets take a look:
    This program uses a unique authentication code for login and password.
    Currently I have added a base ID as abc111 and password being 1234 for you to check.
        It uses a get and post method to invoke API and it hence shows likes, content and title for all the posts.
        The data is dumped in JSON as response
        It sends an API request to create a new post, with an additionality being that you can also add images to it.
